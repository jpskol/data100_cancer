            <h1>A Closer Look into Cervical Cancer</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Incidence of Cervical Cancer</h2>
                <p>
                    Cervical cancer is one of the world's leading causes of death for women. In order to understand why cervical cancer takes so many lives, 
                    it is necessary to first understand how each part of the world deals with the disease.
                </p>
                <h3>Regional breakups of Age-Standardized Incidence Rates show that countries with higher HDI scores have lower rates of cervical cancer</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is a map separated into prominent regions detailing the age-standarized incidence rate (ASIR) of cervical cancer. HDI, or Human Development Index,
                    is a score based on many quality of life factors given to each country by the United Nations. These factors include overall health, standards of living, and education,
                    though others are considered. Over 80% of all deaths caused by cervical cancer occured in lower-resource countries.

                </script>
                <p>
                    The reason for using age-standarized incidence rates rather crude incidence rates is because age-standarization takes out the confounding variable of age,
                    which plays a huge part in immunity to cancer. Typically, the older someone is, the weaker their immune system, and thus a higher rate of cancer.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Why is Incidence So High in Africa?</h2>
                <p>
                    While this may not be the only reason, many regions in Africa have a low HDI in comparison to the rest of the world. And, as mentioned before,
                    countries with a low HDI have less opportunities - specifically less opportunities for healthcare.
                </p>
                <h3>Gardasil covers the Americas, but lacks in Asia and Africa</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), "More than 9 of every 10 cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV. Almost all cervical cancer can be prevented by HPV vaccination."
                    Gardasil, the HPV vaccine, is offered heavily in the Americas, with an average across the continents being 76% covered. But, Eastern areas do not have the same
                    privilage. 
                    <br> <br>
                    It should be noted that the regions on the map are the WHO (World Health Organization) regions, and are simply averages of the region enclosed by each color.
                    This could lead to discrepencies where a certain country bumps the overall region average much higher than data country-by-country would show. Additionally, the
                    Eastern Mediterranian region did not report any data to the WHO in 2022, so their spot on the map is not representative of the actual HPV coverage. 
                </p>
                <iframe title="" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-qrOKU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qrOKU/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="350" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                </script>
                <p>
                    The data presented makes it difficult to draw a direct comparison between vaccine coverage and HDI, but there is still an obvious trend that areas with higher incidence of
                    cervical cancer have a lower coverage of the HPV vaccine.
